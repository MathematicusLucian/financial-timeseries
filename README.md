# financial-timeseries

## Introduction

A Python3 module that utilises the Pandas library, and [Stooq](https://stooq.com/db/) free data API, to demonstrate 'panel data' timeseries analysis of stock data.

- **Time series:** Sequence of numerical data points representing successive, equally spaced points in time, e.g. stock price at regular intervals (presented on a blotter where: price on x-axis; date on y-axis.)

## Long-term

- **Environment:** With requirements.txt etc.
- **Algorithimic trading simulation:** Buying/selling when the price goes above/below a set threshold (determined by algorithm.)
- **Backtesting:** Running the algorithms against past data to see if they are successful (to reduce risk of utilisation of said algorithms to predict future stock movements.)
- **GUI:** Rather than Jupyter Notebook, present asynchronously via a dashboard built on Angular/React.
